Vincent has meanwhile embarked on a new subject – the sower – which he did not mention in the letter to Theo; this indicates that some time has passed. The letter must have been written before the heavy showers that started on 20 June, because Van Gogh says he worked on <hi rend="italics">The Trinquetaille bridge</hi> (<rs type="artwork" ref="artwork.xml#ill_2645">F 426 / JH 1468</rs>) that same afternoon <ref target="#l-17">(l. 17)</ref>. <ref target="let628.xml">Letter 628</ref>, in which the sower has progressed and Van Gogh mentions a new wheatfield, must also predate the change in the weather. We have therefore dated the present letter on or about Sunday, 17 June 1888. Cf. exhib. cat. New York 1984, pp. 70, 105.</p>
