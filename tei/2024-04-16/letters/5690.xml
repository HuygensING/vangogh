<p rend="indent" xml:id="p.en.28" n="28">At this present moment I have found four dealers who have exhibited studies of mine<c type="kp">_</c><ptr target="#note-t-12"/> And I have exchanged studies with several artists<c type="kp">_</c><ptr target="#note-t-13"/></p>

<p rend="indent" xml:id="p.en.29" n="29">Now the prices are 50 francs<c type="kp">_</c> Certainly not much but – as far as I can see one must sell cheap to rise<c type="kk">/</c> and even at costing price<c type="kp">_</c> And mind my dear fellow<c type="kk">/</c> Paris is Paris<c type="kk">/</c> there is but one Paris and however hard living may be here and if it became worse and harder even – the french air clears up the brain and does one good – a world of good<c type="kp">_</c>–</p>

<p rend="indent" xml:id="p.en.30" n="30">I have been in Cormons studio for three or four months but did not find that so useful as I had expected it to be.<ptr target="#note-t-14"/> It may be my fault however<c type="kk">/</c> any how I left there too as I left Antwerp and since I worked alone<c type="kk">/</c> and fancy that since I feel my own self more<c type="kp">_</c>–</p>

<p rend="indent" xml:id="p.en.32" n="32">But for the present things are awfully hard<c type="kk">/</c> therefore let anyone who risks to go over here consider there is no laying on roses at all<c type="kp">_</c></p>

<p rend="indent" xml:id="p.en.33" n="33">What is to be gained is <hi>progress</hi> and<c type="kk">/</c> what the deuce<c type="kk">/</c> that it is to be found here I dare ascertain<c type="kp">_</c> Anyone who has a solid position elsewhere<c type="kk">/</c> let him stay where he is but for adventurers as myself I think they lose nothing in risking more<c type="kp">_</c> Especially as in my case I am not an adventurer by choice but by fate and feeling nowhere so much myself a stranger as in my family and country<c type="kp">_</c>–</p>

<p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Various dates have been suggested for this letter in the past. One important reason for the attention devoted to it in the Van Gogh literature is that the dating is a factor in establishing the period when Van Gogh worked in Cormon’s studio. There are essentially two possibilities: the letter was written either in autumn 1886 or in autumn 1887. Van Heugten places the letter in the period ‘summer-autumn 1887’, primarily on the basis of two similar subjects touched on in a letter from Van Gogh to his sister Willemien written at that time (<ref target="let574.xml">letter 574</ref>): his intended departure for the south of France, which was to happen the following spring; and the use of colour in the landscapes he made at Asnières. Van Gogh did indeed go to Arles in the spring of 1888, and the Asnières landscapes mentioned in the letter to Willemien do date from the spring and summer of 1887, so that the letter must certainly have been written after that. We believe, however, that the present letter contains indications that point to the autumn of 1886; in other words the similar subjects are in fact different.</p>
<p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="indent">Van Gogh writes that since he has been in Paris he has thought about Livens, whom he met at the Antwerp Academy in January-February 1886, very often, even ‘almost daily’ <ref target="#l-96">(l. 96)</ref>. It would seem unlikely that his thoughts would have turned to his former fellow-student at the Academy quite so often after a year and a half in Paris; the same applies to the period of time within which asking to be remembered to four other students is still plausible <ref target="#l-94">(l. 94)</ref>. Van Gogh’s account of what he has been up to would moreover be very perfunctory were it to relate to what he had been doing in Paris for a period of a year and a half; by the autumn of 1887 he was acquainted or friendly with a number of avant-garde artists, he had exhibited on various occasions and even organized exhibitions himself. Japanese prints were a major element of his artistic preoccupations, and in 1887 his view of modern art was so much broader that he is much less likely to have referred to Degas and Monet, as he does here in <ref target="#l-36">ll. 36-37</ref>, than to Signac, Seurat, Toulouse-Lautrec and Bernard. The fact that he gives himself and Livens a chance of joining the colourists also tends to place the letter in 1886 rather than 1887. It gives the distinct impression of being a report of a much shorter stay in Paris.</p>
<p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="indent">What Van Gogh says about painting numerous flower still lifes tallies with what we know of this period (in other words March 1886 - autumn 1886): from the summer of 1886 until mid-September this was one of his main subjects. Several pictures of the windmills in and around Montmartre are candidates for the landscapes with ‘frank’ colours <ref target="#l-61">(ll. 61-62)</ref>. He could moreover have simply meant here that he had started to work in a more colourist manner, and he does not necessarily have to have had specific works in mind. By the ‘two heads’ he may have meant two self-portraits (<ref target="#n-7">see n. 7</ref>). And on top of all this, he does not reckon himself to be one of the Impressionists <ref target="#l-34">(l. 34)</ref> – he would certainly not have said that in 1887.</p>
<p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="indent">This leaves us with the trip to the south; it emerges from a letter Theo wrote to his mother in February 1887 that Vincent had already started to think about this in the winter of 1886-1887 (<ref target="#n-10">see n. 10</ref>).</p>
<p xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="indent">As far as Van Gogh’s time in Cormon’s studio is concerned, this dating means that he must have gone there very soon after his arrival in March, as Van Tilborgh also argues (cf. <ref target="#n-14">n. 14</ref>).</p>

<p>The Englishman <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_142">Horace Mann Livens</rs> went to study at the Antwerp Academy in 1885, when he was twenty-three. During the time that Van Gogh was living and studying there Livens took the winter courses ‘Life’ en ‘Antique statues’. See Antwerp, Bibliotheek Koninklijke Academie, Register 1885-1891, inv. no. 289.

<p>The main exhibitions of Impressionist works during Van Gogh’s stay in Paris up to this point were the <hi xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="italics">VIIIe exposition de peinture</hi>, the last group exhibition of the impressionists  (15 May - 15 June 1886), the <hi xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="italics">Ve exposition</hi> <hi xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="italics">internationale de peinture </hi>at Georges Petit (15 June - 15 July 1886) and the <hi xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="italics">IIe exposition de la Société des Artistes Indépendants </hi>(20 August - 21 September 1886).

<p rend="indent">Before he went to Paris, Van Gogh was reliant for his understanding of Impressionism on information he got from Theo; he had not then seen it for himself. By now, though, he knew exactly what it was about. Henceforth he uses the term Impressionism in the letters in a very general sense for all forms of modern art. He uses it to refer not only to ‘traditional’ Impressionism, but also to what would now be described as ‘Neo-Impressionism’, ‘Synthetism’, ‘Cloisonnism’ etc.</p>

<p>Here ‘nude figure’ and ‘landscape’ could be understood as references to genres, but Van Gogh could also have had specific works by <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_981">Degas</rs> and <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_1222">Monet</rs> in mind.

<p>At the beginning of June 1886 the Van Gogh brothers had moved from 25 rue Laval to a larger apartment at 54 rue Lepic, likewise in Montmartre. Vincent had his own studio there. Theo wrote to <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_761">Caroline van Stockum-Haanebeek</rs> about this apartment on 10 July 1887: ‘As you may know, I am living with my brother Vincent, who is studying painting with indefatigable diligence. Since he needs quite a lot of space for his work, we are living in quite a large apartment in Montmartre (rue Lepic 54) which, as you know, is a suburb of Paris built up against a hill. The remarkable thing about our flat is that from the windows we have a magnificent view across the city with the hills of Meudon, St-Cloud etc. on the horizon, and a piece of sky above it that is almost as big as when one stands on the dunes. With the different effects created by the variations in the sky it is a subject for I don’t know how many paintings’ (FR b727).</p>

<p>Van Gogh did not go to Arles until February 1888, but the fact that he was already toying with the idea of going to the south in the winter of 1886-1887 is confirmed by a letter from Theo to his <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_524">mother</rs> written on 28 February 1887: ‘Things are going along the same as ever here; I obviously didn’t express myself clearly, for you seem to think that Vincent has gone. That’s not the case; he’s still here and doesn’t seem to be planning to go away in the spring as he had originally planned to do. He has painted a couple of portraits that turned out well, but he always does it for nothing. It’s a shame that he doesn’t have any desire to start earning, because if he wanted to he could do it here; but one can’t change a person’ (FR b906).</p>

<p>From <ref xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" target="let718.xml">letter 718</ref> it emerges that Van Gogh exhibited work at the paint merchant <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_772">Julien Tanguy</rs>’s shop and with the art dealers <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_503">Pierre Firmin Martin</rs> and <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_780">Georges Thomas</rs>. We do not know who the fourth dealer was; it may have been the <hi xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" rend="italics">courtier</hi> dealer <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_601">Alphonse Portier</rs>, who lived in the same building as Theo and Vincent.

<p>The period (or periods) when Van Gogh worked at <rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_944">Cormon</rs>’s studio has been the subject of debate. We agree with Van Tilborgh, who argued that this must have been in the months immediately after Van Gogh’s arrival in Paris (early March to early June 1886). See – also for a summary of previous points of view and of literature: Van Tilborgh 2007. The studio was at 104 boulevard de Clichy, in the 18th arrondissement (see Destremau 1997).</p>

<p><rs xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" type="person" ref="bio.xml#_644">Isabella Adriana de Duerwaerder</rs>, the widow of Theodor Jacques van Roosmaelen, lived at 25 Mutsaardstraat (district 2) in Antwerp and was a ‘shopkeeper in artists’ materials’. Various English and Scottish students at the Antwerp Academy were registered as lodging at this address in the 1880-1893 period. On 6 March 1893, Mrs van Roosmaelen moved to number 16 Blindenstraat in Antwerp, near the entrance to the Academy.
